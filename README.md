Welcome to the frontend repo for TennAi, a project for CSC 385 at Murray State University. Here, you will find all the necessary files and uploads to run a prototype version of TennAi's frontend programming. Main features include a welcome page highlighting features, a demo login, demo dashboard, and demo survey builder. Tenny, the AI assistant that will help users, is currently inactive and will only display demo messages. All information seen is for demo purposes only. If a button or page does not do anything when refreshed or pressed, it has not been coded yet. We hope you enjoy this sneek peek at what we are creating, and if you have any questions, let us know. Thanks!

To run locally, do the following:

Install ALL files in the same folder.
Locate the index file either through file explorer, finder, or your IDE.
If you have live server extension installed, run from there. If not, file explorer or finder should have an option to "run through", select safari, chrome, etc.
